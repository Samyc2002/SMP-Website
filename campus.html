					equipped labs for various disciplines which include two Computer labs, a Physics Lab, a Chemistry
					Lab, a Fluid Dynamics Lab, a Mechanical Workshop, a Strength of Materials Lab, a Heat Transfer Lab,
					a Measurements Lab, Electronics Lab,
					Electronics Power Lab,etc. As more courses are being introduced, labs are being established. There

					usually closes much earlier.There is also
					a night canteen in the Bhoopali building which will be open till 2:00 am.

					<h2>
						Nearby Places
					</h2>
					IIT Dharwad's location, being on a National Highway means that there are multiple places nearby to
					eat and hang out. While there is ample to do, we'll be only covering food and let you explore the
					rest.


					<h3>Local</h3>
					First of all, there is a Cafe Coffee Day opposite our campus. Near the Cafe Coffee Day is Hyderabadi
					Biryani Restaurant. The biryani here is excellent and reasonably priced. Another nearby place is
					Roti Ghar. It is a pure-veg restaurant. The
					food is good and fairly priced and the place is hygenic. A little away from the campus (around 4km
					towards Dharwad) there is a vegetarian cafe called Seven Beans. It can be reached by cycle or by
					taking a tum-tum. It is a board game cafe
					where you can play Jenga, Snakes and Ladders, Ludo etc while eating. It also has a pool table.
					Around a kilometer away, there is Malabar, which is a non-veg restaurant. Also around 8-9 km from
					the campus is a hotel called Dwarwata. The
					restaurant serves both veg and non-veg food. It is a bit highly priced but the food is good. There
					is also a rooftop place.


					<h3>Dharwad City</h3>
					There is a Dominos in Dharwad. Chilly Chow and Royal kitchen are the other good restaurants in
					Dharwad. CrossRoads Bistro is another small meet up place with delicious ice-creams.


					<h3>Hubli</h3>
					Hubli, AKA Huballi, can be easily reached now via the BRTS (Chigari) bus service. It is a chain of
					air conditioned buses connecting Hubli and Dharwad. It starts from the New Bus Stand in Dharwad. The
					frequency of buses is very high and the
					bus stations are clean and sophisticated. The cost of the ticket is around Rs. 25. Hubli being a
					larger city than Dharwad has a lot more to offer. There is a very scenic lake called lake Unnakal
					which has a garden on its banks (not highly
					recommended though). There is a mall called Urban Oasis which has a multiplex within it. Near this
					mall there is also Barbeque Nation. There is a decently sized decathlon in Hubli with a small
					concrete turf/basketball court which can be
					booked. There is also a much larger choice of places to eat in Hubli in general.

				<div class="gen-block" id="hostels">
					<h2>
						Hostels
					</h2>
					A lot of you would surely be leaving your house for the first time while others may know a little
					about hostel culture. In any case a good hostel culture and atmosphere is only going to boost your
					morale at all times, be it during exams or a
					festival celebration. At IIT Dharwad the hostels provided are among the best ones among all the IITs
					(maybe because they’re quite new). The first year hostel is located right beside the academic
					building (so you can just wake up and run to
					your class). All other hostels are located 1.4 km behind at the far end of the campus along with the
					sports grounds and the famous Bhoopali building which houses the gymkhana, mess, a night
					canteen,etc. The first year hostel is a co-ed hostel
					with the ground floor housing the Girls’ Wing, the Keeravani Mess and the lobby and TV area. Boys
					are allocated rooms on the first and second floors. There is 24/7 security in front of all the
					hostels.


					<h3>Hostel Allocation</h3>
					Hostel rooms will be allocated to the first year students’ prior to their registration. The keys of
					the respective rooms would be provided to the students right after their registration on the
					reporting day. The first year students’ hostel
					(also known as Keeravani Hostel, yes it is named after a raga in classical music) has 3 floors with
					every room accommodating 4 students (yes, there’ll be bunk beds which are fun :P).

					<h3>Basic Amenities</h3>
					Each room has a pair of bunk beds (4 beds), tables, chairs, cupboards, ceiling fans, tubelights and
					are equipped with 24x7 high speed internet connectivity. Rooms have attached washrooms with 24x7
					running water. There are geysers in the
					washrooms and there is availability of hot water according to a time table (which you will find on
					the hostel notice board). Washing machines (4 to be precise) are also available on the ground floor,
					timings for which again will be available
					on the notice board. The Keeravani Hostel has its own mess (dining hall), water coolers, TV room and
					indoor games like Table Tennis, Chess and Carrom.


					<h3>Hostel Activities</h3>
					There are a plethora of activities that go around in the hostels which makes life fun. A variety of
					festivals like Holi, Ganesh Chaturthi, Dussehra, Diwali, Makar Sankranti, Teacher’s Day, Women’s Day
					etc. are celebrated in the hostels, along
					with flag hoisting on Republic Day and Independence Day, keeping the atmosphere in the hostels
					vibrant and lively the entire year around. Do participate in whatever intrigues you, of course after
					having devoted enough time to academics. It
					helps you in breaking the ice and socializing with your batchmates and seniors as well.


					<h3>Hostel Council</h3>
					All the hostel affairs would be dealt under the supervision of the General Secretary Hostel Affairs
					(GSHA, whom you will get to know in your orientation programme). There is a Hostel Secretary for
					each hostel along with room representatives
					to make sure all the odd jobs of the hostels are taken care of. Each hostel has its own warden who
					will be your point of contact for all the issues you are facing in the hostel, which will be
					announced during the orientation programme. All
					important contact numbers are displayed on the notice board of the hostels. There will also be a
					separate mess committee (comprising the first year students) for the Keeravani Mess. There will be a
					separate Sports Secretary & Cultural
					Secretary to look after respective matters among the first year students. As far as the apex council
					is concerned, we have General Secretaries for Sports Affairs, Mess Affairs, Cultural Affairs,
					Academic Affairs and Hostel Affairs who look
					after respective matters for the whole institution.

					<br>
					<br>
					PS: All hostel buildings and the famous Bhoopali building at IIT Dharwad are named after ragas of
					classical music (along with a number starting from 0 for the Keeravani Hostel) showing the cultural
					background of Dharwad as a birthplace of
					legendary musicians.

					to uploading your Instagram stories, the internet is one thing you need to sort out ASAP to avoid
					getting a FOMO. The entire campus of IIT
					Dharwad is WiFi enabled. Just turn on your WiFi and connect to IITDh-Wireless or eduroam with your
					LDAP ID (roll number) and password (you will be provided with all relevant instructions).
