                <h2>Tips to prepare for TOFEL</h2>
                <p class="excert">
                  There’s no way around it, the more you practice, the higher you will score! But do you know how to
                  make the best use of your time, money, energy and other resources as you prepare? </p>

                <ol>
                  <li><strong>Get to Know the TOEFL Format: </strong>
                    <p>Surprises on the TOEFL are anything but fun. So before you take the exam, try to familiarize
                      yourself with all of the basic features of the TOEFL and its scoring system. You should know what
                      the TOEFL sections are, how these
                      sections are arranged, how much time you’ll have on each section, and what kinds of questions and
                      prompts you’ll get.</p>
                    <p>By understanding how the TOEFL is structured, you’ll know exactly what to expect on test day and
                      can thus prepare accordingly—and more confidently.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li><strong> Set a Goal Score: </strong>
                    <p>To ensure you’ll have the best possible shot at getting accepted to the schools you’re applying
                      to, you’ll need to set a TOEFL goal score. A goal score is any total score that meets all of your
                      schools’ minimum required (or
                      recommended) TOEFL scores.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Give Yourself Ample Time to Prepare: </strong>
                    <p>Before you register for the TOEFL, set aside ample time to prepare for the exam and hone your
                      English-language skills. Three to six months of study time should generally suffice. However,
                      exact time frames will vary depending on
                      your English ability and the amount of time you can dedicate to studying.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Choose an Early Test Date: </strong>
                    <p>An early test date ensures that your TOEFL scores will get to your schools in time. TOEFL scores
                      are sent automatically by mail to schools you selected during registration beginning 13 days after
                      your test.</p>
                    <p>However, the location of your school will determine how long it’ll take for your scores to
                      arrive. Schools located within the US typically receive scores about 20-30 days after the test
                      date, whereas schools located outside the
                      US usually receive them six to eight weeks after the test.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, if you’re applying to US schools, try to take the TOEFL no later than six weeks before
                      your college application deadlines. If you’re applying to schools located outside the US, take the
                      TOEFL no later than ten weeks
                      before your deadlines.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li><strong> Improve Your Vocabulary: </strong>
                    <p>To do well on the TOEFL, you need to have a high range of English vocabulary. Knowing different
                      words allows you to more readily understand the English you read and hear, and gives you the tools
                      to express yourself more clearly
                      and effectively in speech and writing.</p>
                    <p>Ultimately, the best way to study vocabulary is to use flashcards. You can either make your own
                      paper cards or opt for digital cards. Anki is a free computer program you can use to create,
                      download, and practice flashcards. It
                      uses spaced-repetition software (SRS) to show you difficult cards more often than other cards.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Answer Every Question: </strong>
                    <p>Like the SAT, ACT, and GRE, there are no penalties for wrong answers on the TOEFL. In other
                      words, if you answer a question incorrectly (or don’t answer it at all), you won’t lose any
                      points. Therefore, you should always answer
                      every question in a section to ensure you’ll have the best possible shot at getting the score you
                      want.</p>
                    <p>On the Reading and Listening sections, every multiple-choice question has four answer choices. So
                      if you guessed on one, you’d have a 25 percent chance of getting it right.</p>
                    <p>Ultimately, if you’re clueless as to how to answer a question or are running out of time, it’s
                      far better to just guess (ideally, by using the process of elimination!) than to not answer at
                      all.</p>
                  </li>

                  <li><strong>Read Complex Texts: </strong>
                    <p>The best way to improve your reading ability is to read as many English-language texts as you
                      can. By doing this, you’ll not only enhance your vocabulary and grammar knowledge, but you’ll also
                      learn how arguments are structured
                      and what ultimately makes them compelling to read.</p>
                    <p>As you read, be sure you understand the main point of the text and what the author is trying to
                      say. You should also be able to identify what kinds of transitions and organizational patterns the
                      author uses in order to
                      effectively present his or her thoughts.</p>
                  </li>
