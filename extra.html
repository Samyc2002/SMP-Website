          Excellence in sports is a direct index of the stature and intellectual maturity of an institute. All the

          craft and their more experienced counterparts can receive the requisite guidance. IIT Dharwad offers its
          students the following sports facilities:

          <p></p>
          <br>
          <table class="table">
            <tbody>

          <p></p>
          <h3>Sports for everyone</h3>
          To ensure a healthy continuity of this tradition the Sports Council organises a multitude of sports and
          fitness camps that vary in the degree of professionalism (amateur, intermediate or advanced) as well as the
          rigour of instruction.
          The Government of India, through the National Sports Organisation, mandates that all incoming freshmen must
          undergo a structured training in a sport of their choice. At IIT Dharwad, NSO forms an integral part of the
          curriculum and classes are offered in a student’s sport of choice.
